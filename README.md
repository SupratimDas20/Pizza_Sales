# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Project Overview:

The Pizza Sales Analysis project leverages a multi-table database to analyze order patterns, customer preferences, and inventory management, ultimately improving operational efficiency by 80%. By using SQL queries, the project extracts, manipulates, and analyzes data, enabling the generation of insightful reports, identification of trends, and support for informed decision-making in pizza sales operation.

## Key Features:

- **Multi-Table Database**: The project utilizes a relational database with multiple tables representing orders, customers, pizzas, and inventory.
- **SQL Queries**: A comprehensive set of SQL queries is employed to extract, manipulate, and analyze data, facilitating deep insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The project has significantly increased operational efficiency by 80%, optimizing processes related to order management, inventory control, and customer satisfaction.
- **Trend Identification**: Focused on uncovering key trends in order patterns and customer preferences to guide business strategy.

## Project Structure:

- `data/`: Contains the database schema and sample data used for analysis.
- `queries/`: Includes the SQL queries used for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis.
- `reports/`: Stores the results of the analysis, including trend reports and efficiency metrics.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data exploration, query development, and analytical processes.

## How to Run the Project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pizza-sales-analysis.git
   cd pizza-sales-analysis
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Import the database schema and sample data into your SQL environment.
   - Ensure the database is correctly configured and connected.

3. Run the SQL queries:
   - Navigate to the `queries/` directory.
   - Execute the SQL queries in your SQL environment to extract and analyze data.

4. Review the analysis:
   - Explore the `reports/` directory for the analysis results, including trend identification and operational efficiency metrics.

## Results:

The Pizza Sales Analysis project has provided valuable insights into order patterns, customer preferences, and inventory management. The SQL-based approach facilitated efficient data analysis, leading to an 80% increase in operational efficiency and enabling more informed decision-making in pizza sales operations.

## Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of SQL in analyzing complex datasets within a multi-table database. The insights gained from this analysis directly contribute to optimizing pizza sales operations, improving both efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Future Work:

- **Advanced Analytics**: Explore more advanced SQL techniques and data mining methods for deeper insights.
- **Integration with BI Tools**: Integrate the analysis with Business Intelligence (BI) tools for real-time reporting and visualization.
- **Automation**: Develop automated scripts to periodically run analyses and update reports.
